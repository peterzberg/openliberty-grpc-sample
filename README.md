# Open Liberty gRPC sample/playground

This is just a small playground to experiment with gRPC. Looks like a little bit of overengineering, and well, it is :) Reason for that is that we have an existing SOAP RPC at my company, 
where the API and the client libraries (and base server impl) is defined by a DSL and generated by a code generator. We want to reuse the DSL and generator and produce grpc server and client implementations.

more to come... :)
